      <p>Similar to Sudoku every digit must not appear more than
	once in each column and in each row.</p>
      <p>Departing from Sudoku, neighboring white fields form streets,
	and must be filled with consecutive digits, in any order.
	Three neighboring white fields could be filled with 9-7-8
	or 3-2-1. Each time a set of digits with no hole.</p>
      <p>Note that the numbers in black fields are only hints
	and are not part of any streets. Streets are only the white
	fields.</p>
      <p>Mouse over the board to focus a field. Type a digit
	while a field is focused to place it. Remove a digit with
	Del or Backspace.</p>
      <p>Pass on the game by sending the URL to anyone who
	might enjoy it.</p>
